## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to learning Core Java from scratch. As a Python developer, I'm expanding my skills by exploring Java's unique syntax, object-oriented features, and powerful libraries. Each section below explains what I’ve learned and provides examples for each concept.

## Setup and Requirements
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Download and install the latest JDK from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.
2. **IDE** - I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code with Java extensions.

## Topics Covered

### Basics
Here are the basics of Java, covering syntax, data types, operators, and control structures.
- **Programs:**
  - `HelloWorld.java`: The classic first program in Java.
  - `Calculator.java`: A simple calculator demonstrating basic input and arithmetic operations.
  
### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
This section includes fundamental OOP concepts, like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Programs:**
  - `InheritanceExample.java`: Demonstrates inheritance and the use of the `extends` keyword.
  - `EncapsulationExample.java`: Explores encapsulation and the use of `private` and `public` access modifiers.

### Data Structures
Java's Collections framework, including `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and other data structures.
- **Programs:**
  - `ArrayListDemo.java`: Shows basic usage of `ArrayList` for dynamic arrays.
  - `HashMapDemo.java`: Demonstrates using a `HashMap` for key-value pairs.

### File Handling
Basic file operations like reading from and writing to files.
- **Programs:**
  - `ReadWriteFile.java`: Reads from and writes to a text file, demonstrating Java’s I/O capabilities.

## Projects
As I progress, I'll add small projects that integrate multiple concepts:
- **Library Management System**: A command-line application for managing books in a library, using classes and collections.

## Resources
- [Official Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
- Online courses from platforms like [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
- Practice sites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/)
